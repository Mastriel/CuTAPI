# CuTAPI
Short for (Cu)stom (T)hings API, this aims to simplify creating unique experiences 
for your Minecraft servers.

The API is Kotlin-first to provide the best developer
experience.

## THIS IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT!!
Here's a rundown of what works well right now:
- Custom Items
- Custom ItemStack types
- Resource Pack Generation (pretty limited right now, only really textures)

I wouldn't recommend using this in a completely production-ready server yet. It's still pretty unstable
and things like function names will change significantly over time.
